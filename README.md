# Traffic Rules

Rules about safer traffic.


## How to work on the project?

1. Fork it.
2. Clone that.
3. Build that.
4. Make changes.
5. Commit them.
6. `git push origin master` or whatever branch you want.
7. Raise a pull request.

## How to build?

`upstream` in your clone repo git config points to this repo.

`master` is main branch. Never make changes to it. Always create a feature branch.

```
git pull --rebase upstream master
pub install
pub serve
```
